Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts the Income of DANHOS, one of the largest Real Estate Investment Trusts (FIBRAs) in Mexico. Using quarterly data from Q4 2013 to Q4 2024, we explore how macroeconomic and sectoral indicators influence the company’s performance over time.¶
Our dataset integrates key economic variables such as inflation, exchange rate (USDMXN), sectoral GDPs, unemployment rate, bond yields (MBONO), and consumer confidence index (CCI) — all of which can significantly affect the real estate sector and, therefore, DANHOS’s revenues.

Methodology
We employ several statistical and machine learning models to both explain and predict the company’s income dynamics:
- Normal Distribution Analysis:
Used to evaluate the distribution of residuals and ensure the assumptions of normality for our regression models.
- T-Test:
Applied to assess the statistical significance of independent variables and determine which macroeconomic factors have the strongest explanatory power over DANHOS’s income.
- Multiple Linear Regression:
Built to estimate how each economic indicator impacts the firm’s income, helping to identify key drivers and quantify their relationships.
- Random Forest Model:
Implemented as a nonlinear, ensemble-based approach to enhance predictive accuracy and capture complex interactions among variables that traditional regressions may miss.

Conclusion
After testing different statistical and machine learning approaches to model the Income of DANHOS, our results show that the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model performs best for both interpretation and future prediction.¶
Key Insights:
Multiple Linear Regression is the most appropriate model for this analysis because it allows us to:
- Quantify the individual impact of each macroeconomic variable on DANHOS’s income.
- Preserve interpretability, which is essential in financial and econometric analysis.
- Generate reliable forecasts for future quarters.
The Random Forest model, while useful for nonlinear relationships, did not outperform the regression model because:
- The dependent variable (Income) is continuous, not categorical.
- The dataset’s size and frequency (quarterly data) favor a linear, econometric approach over ensemble machine learning methods.
Model validation:
- The final regression model successfully passed all diagnostic tests, confirming its robustness:
- VIF test: No multicollinearity issues among independent variables.
- Breusch–Pagan test (BP): Homoscedastic residuals, indicating constant variance.
- Durbin–Watson test (DW): No evidence of autocorrelation.
- Anderson–Darling test (AD): Residuals follow a normal distribution.
Final Remark
The validated multiple regression model provides strong statistical significance and serves as a reliable analytical tool for forecasting future income of DANHOS based on macroeconomic indicators. This makes it the most effective model for both interpretation and prediction in financial decision-making.
