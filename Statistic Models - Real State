Final Project - Statistics and Data Analytics

Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts the Income of DANHOS, one of the largest Real Estate Investment Trusts (FIBRAs) in Mexico. Using quarterly data from Q4 2013 to Q4 2024, we explore how macroeconomic and sectoral indicators influence the company’s performance over time.¶
Our dataset integrates key economic variables such as inflation, exchange rate (USDMXN), sectoral GDPs, unemployment rate, bond yields (MBONO), and consumer confidence index (CCI) — all of which can significantly affect the real estate sector and, therefore, DANHOS’s revenues.

Methodology
We employ several statistical and machine learning models to both explain and predict the company’s income dynamics:
- Normal Distribution Analysis:
Used to evaluate the distribution of residuals and ensure the assumptions of normality for our regression models.
- T-Test:
Applied to assess the statistical significance of independent variables and determine which macroeconomic factors have the strongest explanatory power over DANHOS’s income.
- Multiple Linear Regression:
Built to estimate how each economic indicator impacts the firm’s income, helping to identify key drivers and quantify their relationships.
- Random Forest Model:
Implemented as a nonlinear, ensemble-based approach to enhance predictive accuracy and capture complex interactions among variables that traditional regressions may miss.
